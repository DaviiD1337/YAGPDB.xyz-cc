# YAGPDB.xyz-cc

This is a Repository made by me and I will add all the CC's that I made by myself, or modified or collaborate with other CC's.

Here are the List of CC's here for now:-

## 1. Bump CC
 
### Removed due to Disboard's Changing ToS

## 2. Help CC

This is a Help CC that splits CC Help and inbuilt Help. It works with/without Crafter's `Custom Commands` CC. More details inside the file.  

## 3. Election CC

This is a Election CC, which can be used to vote for many users. You cannot vote for yourself, and also, cannot have more than one vote.

### Note:- When you use the above Election CC, you need to reset the `Vote_Cooldown` and `Vote` Databases. (Case-Sensitive)

## 4. User Info

A User Info CC, when a user joins, sends it to the Log Channel, so that you can analyze the User if he is a self-bot/breaks the ToS

## This is meant to be an inexhaustive CC page. If you come across any issues, join my [Discord Server](https://dsc.gg/gamerscorner) and create a ticket.
