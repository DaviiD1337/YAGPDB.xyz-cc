# YAGPDB.xyz-cc

This is a Repository made by me and I will add all the CC's that I made by myself, or modified or collaborate with other CC's.

Here are the List of CC's here for now:-

## 1. Bump CC
 
This is a Bump CC, which shows you the Bumping LeaderBoard, Bump Level, Bump Pings and Strikes out the Bump Message after the Bump is done.

### Warning:- Bump Leaderboards are against Disboard's ToS. Use it at your own risk.

## 2. Help CC

This is a Help CC that splits CC Help and inbuilt Help. It works with/without Crafter's `Custom Commands` CC. More details inside the file.  

## 3. Election CC

This is a Election CC, which can be used to vote for many users. You cannot vote for yourself, and also, cannot have more than one vote.

### Note:- When you use the above Election CC, you need to reset the `Vote_Cooldown` and `Vote` Databases. (Case-Sensitive)

## This is meant to be an inexhaustive CC page. If you come across any issues, join my [Discord Server](https://dsc.gg/gamerscorner) and create a ticket.
